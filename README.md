Challenge Framework

Why did I choose Esprima vs Acorn? Which has better perf? File size? API 
quality? Documentation?
What are my goals? To be able to parse the Javascript of students and give 
feedback in real time / support modern browsers. The tests should not be 
blocking such that when new input is added, the tests are run again.
How does the API look?
